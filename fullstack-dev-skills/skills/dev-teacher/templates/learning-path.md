## Adaptive Recommendations

Based on your progress, the dev-teacher may suggest:

### If Struggling (score < 60%)
```
"Let's slow down and strengthen fundamentals.
Try: 'Teach me [basic concept] from scratch'"
```

### If On Track (score 60-80%)
```
"Good progress! Let's deepen understanding.
Try: 'Quiz me on [topic] with harder questions'"
```

### If Excelling (score > 80%)
```
"Excellent! Ready for advanced topics.
Try: 'Explain the tradeoffs of [architecture decision]'"
```
